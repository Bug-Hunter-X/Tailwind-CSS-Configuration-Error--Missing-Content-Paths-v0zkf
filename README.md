# Tailwind CSS Configuration Error: Missing Content Paths

This repository demonstrates a common error in configuring Tailwind CSS: failing to include all relevant source files in the `content` array of the `tailwind.config.js` file. This leads to Tailwind not recognizing your custom styles, resulting in unexpected behavior or missing styles.

## Bug Description:

The original `tailwind.config.js` file only includes the `./src` directory in the `content` array. If components or HTML files using Tailwind classes are located elsewhere (e.g., in a `./components` directory), Tailwind will not process them.  This results in the styles not being applied.

## Solution:

The solution involves correctly specifying the paths to all directories containing files using Tailwind classes. The `tailwind.config.fixed.js` file provides a corrected configuration including the `./components` directory.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the directory.
3.  Observe that styling will be incomplete or missing in the original `tailwind.config.js` example.
4.  Replace the `tailwind.config.js` file with `tailwind.config.fixed.js`
5.  Observe that the styling will now work correctly.
