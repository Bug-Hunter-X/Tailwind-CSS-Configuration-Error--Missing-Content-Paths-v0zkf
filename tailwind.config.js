```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration only includes the `./src` directory, which might cause Tailwind to miss certain components or styles if they are located outside of this directory.  If you have other directories containing components or HTML files that use Tailwind classes, you need to include them in the `content` array. For instance, if you have styles in a `./components` folder, you'd need to adjust the config as follows:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{html,js}", "./components/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
